# My-notebook-1.0

Hello, I decided to write a notebook where you can add site accounts, modify them and view a complete list of all accounts. 
The plans are to create a GUI, create accounts for the notebook itself with a login and password, 
so that several users can keep their notes on one computer and in one program, 
improve the program's performance, add various exceptions when entering data, I will try to add a beautiful design. 
I don’t know yet what else to tell you, maybe I’ll complete my plans) Thank you for your attention!)

update 1.1

- Changed the program menu
- Added account counter in the database (displays the total number in the main menu)
- Fixed algorithm for adding accounts (blank user input lines cause an error and the program asks to try again)
- Added a notification when the menu number is entered incorrectly.
