# My-notebook-1.0

Hello, I decided to write a notebook where you can add site accounts, modify them and view a complete list of all accounts. 
The plans are to create a GUI, create accounts for the notebook itself with a login and password, 
so that several users can keep their notes on one computer and in one program, 
improve the program's performance, add various exceptions when entering data, I will try to add a beautiful design. 
I don’t know yet what else to tell you, maybe I’ll complete my plans) Thank you for your attention!)
